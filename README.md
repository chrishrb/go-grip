## :question: About

**go-grip** is a lightweight, Go-based tool designed to render Markdown files locally, replicating GitHub's style. It offers features like syntax highlighting, dark mode, and support for mermaid diagrams, providing a seamless and visually consistent way to preview Markdown files in your browser.

This project is a reimplementation of the original Python-based [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip), which uses GitHub's web API for rendering. By eliminating the reliance on external APIs, go-grip delivers similar functionality while being fully self-contained, faster, and more secure - perfect for offline use or privacy-conscious users.

## :hammer: Usage

By default, go-grip generates static HTML files from your markdown. To render a markdown file:

```bash
go-grip README.md
```

The generated HTML will be saved in your cache directory by default, and the browser will automatically open to view it. You can specify a custom output directory:

```bash
go-grip -o /path/to/output README.md
```

To run as a server instead of generating static files:

```bash
go-grip --server README.md
```

You can also specify a port for the server:

```bash
go-grip --server -p 80 README.md
```

To disable automatic browser opening:

```bash
go-grip -b=false README.md
```

To activate dark mode:

```bash
go-grip --theme dark README.md
```
